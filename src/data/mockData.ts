            "description": "It is the greatest environmental challenge of the 21st Century. But what do we truly know about global climate change? And what can we do about it? Most of the world's top scientists agree that emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from human activities such as industrial processes, fossil fuel combustion, and land-use changes are causing the earth to get warmer. Impacts of this warming may include damage to our coastal areas, accelerated rates of species loss, altered agricultural patterns, and increased incidences of infectious diseases. The effects of climate change - and efforts to mitigate climate change - could also have substantial economic ramifications. The book presents the latest research and analysis from prominent scientists, economists, academics, and policy-makers, including: \"Tom Wigley\" and \"Joel Smith,\" who, along with other authors of the Science and Impacts chapter, explain the basic science of climate change, the growing evidence that human activities are changing our climate, and the impacts of these changes; \"Eileen Claussen,\" \"John Gummer,\" \"Henry Lee,\" and other authors of the Global Strategies chapter, who describe what nations are or are not doing to address climate change, and the state of international climate talks; \"Robert Stavins,\" \"John Weyant,\" \"Ev Ehrlich,\" and other economists, who explain why economic analyses of climate policy are conducted, why the projected costs of addressing climate change vary so widely among economic models, and how changes driven by today's economy can influence climate policy; \"Gov. Jean Shaheen\" and other authors of the Innovative Solutions chapter, who describe what state and local governments in theUnited States and multinational companies are doing to monitor and curb greenhouse gas emissions; and \"Forest Reinhardt,\" who offers business leaders advice on steering their companies on a path that is healthy for business as well as the global climate. This publication has also been published in paperback, please click here for details.",

His only joy is the appearance of a woman by the name of Esmerelda who takes pity on him because of his circumstances. Esmerelda, after attracting unwanted attention from members of the Church finds herself in a battle for her life, and seemingly only Quasimodo, the man she has taken pity on can save her.A mad priest, a vagabond playwright, a social-climbing soldier, and a deformed bell-ringer all are captivated by a gypsy girl's beauty and charm. Two of them will betray her, but the others will remain loyal, even in the shadow of the gallows. These outlaws find sanctuary within the walls of medieval Paris' greatest monument, the grand Cathedral of Notre Dame.\"What a beautiful thing Notre-Dame is!\" declared Gustave Flaubert of Victor Hugo's 1837 novel. Originally published as Notre-Dame de Paris (Our Lady of Paris), it was conceived as a story of the cathedral itself, which functioned as the passionate heart of fifteenth-century city life. But Hugo's human drama rivals the Gothic masterpiece for dominance. Drawn with humor and compassion, his characters endure, both in literary history and in readers' imaginations: Frollo, the sinister archdeacon; Quasimodo, the hideous hunchback; and the enchanting outcast, Esmeralda.",

This volume completes the general topographical coverage begun in volume I, and will be followed by a third volume dealing specifically with the major cities of Jerusalem, Acre and Tyre (which are excluded from the preceding volumes). The project, of which this series represents the final, definitive publication, has been sponsored by the British School of Archaeology in Jerusalem. On completion the corpus will contain a topographical listing of all the 400 or more church buildings of the Kingdom that are attested by documentary or surviving archaeological evidence, and individual descriptions and discussion of them in terms of their identification, building history and architecture. Some of the buildings have been published before, but many others are published here for the first time.",

            "description": "This broad treatment of architecture throughout the region of the Himalaya mountains is the first book of its kind. The author has based this study on many years of research in Nepal, Sikkim, Bhutan, Assam, and the Darjeeling area of northeast India, northern Pakistan, and Himachal Pradesh in India's northwest. These areas make up an artistic and, to some degree, a cultural unit. It is unique and definable for its design qualities as well as its use of materials. Dramatic and lofty structures rise as towering palaces and as temples dedicated to Hindu and Buddhist ideals. The impact of neighboring Tibet and India is often evident in the art, but other influences are found as well. The area has not been isolated, as some studies suggest, but was in fact always linked to the rest of Asia and to the West by means of the Silk Road, at least since the second century B.C. This study progresses from east to west, beginning in the foothills of India's Assam. It is richly illustrated with photographs, most of which are the author's or his wife's, and many of the photographs are published here for the first time. The archives of the Archaeological Survey of India and the Department of Archaeology of His Majesty's Government of Nepal are also used here.",
